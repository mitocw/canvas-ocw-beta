The first player to build a consecutive sequence of four of their own tokens wins the game. The sequence of four tokens can lie either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this way, Connect Four is similar to other games you might know, such as Tic-tac-toe.</p>\\r\\n<p>Stated more abstractly, Connect Four is a game where each player has seven possible moves in a turn, corresponding to the seven columns where the player can drop the piece (unless the column is full, in which case the player cannot move there).</p>\\r\\n<p>We have provided an <a title=\"\" href=\"#ConnectFourBoard\">API</a> for constructing and manipulating Connect Four boards. We suggest you take a look at the API now before getting started. For the first part of this lab, you will define subroutines that</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>determine whether the game is over,</li>\\r\\n<li>generate a player\\'s set of possible moves, and</li>\\r\\n<li>assign scores to boards.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>These subroutines will provide the necessary definitions for treating Connect Four boards as states in a game tree, which will be useful in the second half of this lab.</p>\\r\\n<a name=\"Game_over\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Game over </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Return <tt>True</tt> if the game is over, otherwise <tt>False</tt>. The game is over when the board contains a chain of length 4 (or longer), or all columns are full.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def is_game_over_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Generating_all_possible_moves\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Generating all possible moves </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Return a list of boards representing the game state that can result by making a single move in any legal column.</p>\\r\\n<p>First, you should check in advance if the game is already over and return the empty list if so. If the game is not over, then, at most, you can move in any of the seven columns. But you cannot legally move in a column if it\\'s full, and so you should exclude those.</p>\\r\\n<p>Note that these next-states that are generated should be the result of the <i>current</i> player playing a piece, which means that in each of the next-states, the <i>other</i> player is the \"current\" player because they have yet to make a move.</p>\\r\\n<p>For each board in the list, <tt>board.prev_move_string()</tt> notes the column in which a piece was played (for debugging purposes).</p>\\r\\n<p>Note: iterate over columns in increasing numerical order.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def next_boards_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Assigning_points_to_the_winner\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Assigning points to the winner </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Here, we\\'ll define the final score of a Connect Four game that has been won. We\\'ll return a score of 1000 if the maximizer has won, or -1000 if the minimizer has won. In case of a tie, return 0 instead. A tie occurs when the entire board fills up but has no chains of 4 or more same-colored tokens.</p>\\r\\n<p>Important subtlety regarding endgame scoring: We don\\'t know if a game is over until we take the board and call <tt>is_game_over_connectfour(board)</tt> on it. The board represents the state of the game after the previous player moved, but before the current player has played. Hence, if the game is already over, it\\'s because <i>the previous player played the final move, ending the game.</i> Therefore, if the game is over and someone has won, it\\'s not the <i>current</i> player who has won, because it just became the current player\\'s \"turn\"; instead, the previous player has won.</p>\\r\\n<p>In short, although it is slightly counter-intuitive, the endgame scoring function should return -1000 for a winning board if the current player is the maximizer (because that means the minimizer played the winning move), and +1000 if the current player is the minimizer.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def endgame_score_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Win_already.21\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Win already! </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>The previous <tt>endgame_score_connectfour</tt> function has the drawback that it doesn\\'t reward players for winning sooner, since all winning states have the same value. Therefore, it doesn\\'t encourage the computer to win as fast as possible the way a human would. To remedy this, write a score function that rewards players for winning sooner: that is, it should assign a better score to games that are won in fewer moves.</p>\\r\\n<p>To retain consistency with your other endgame scoring function, make sure you return a value with <tt>abs(score) &gt;= 1000</tt> to indicate that someone has won. (In this lab, scores of magnitude 1000 or greater will correspond to winning game states, whereas scores of magnitude &lt; 1000 will correspond to games that have not yet been won.)</p>\\r\\n<pre>def endgame_score_connectfour_faster(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<p>Hint: you can use <tt>board.count_pieces()</tt> to help determine how long the game has gone on.</p>\\r\\n<a name=\"A_heuristic_for_ConnectFour_boards\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">A heuristic for ConnectFour boards </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>In practice, it is infeasible to search all the way to the leaves of the game tree in order to find a score. (Imagine ranking opening chess moves by whether they are automatic wins/losses for perfect play.)</p>\\r\\n<p>Instead, here we will define a heuristic for estimating the \"goodness\" of a state --- specifically the goodness of a Connect Four board --- and use that in place of an endgame scoring function when we want to stop evaluation before reaching the end of the game.</p>\\r\\n<p>In practice, designing accurate heuristics greatly assists the decision making of strong game-playing AIs. Developing a good heuristic is a matter of design: there are many possible strategies and ways of measuring/defining the goodness of a state; for the purposes of this lab, you only need to define a scoring function that gives better scores for obviously stronger Connect Four positions.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def heuristic_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<p>As a hint, much of the information about the goodness of a state concerns the <strong>number and length of both players\\' chains</strong>. And, just to remain consistent with endgame scores, the absolute value of the heuristic scores should be scaled to be less than 1000. As before, the returned score will be negated depending on whether the current player is the maximizer.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, you might return:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>500 for a board in which the maximizer is doing much better</li>\\r\\n<li>10 for a board in which the maximizer is doing only slightly better</li>\\r\\n<li>0 for a board in which neither player seems to have an advantage</li>\\r\\n<li>-10 for a board in which the minimizer is doing slightly better</li>\\r\\n<li>...and so on.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<a name=\"On_to_Abstract_Game_States\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">On to Abstract Game States </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Transforming the game into an abstract game state will allow us to explore the evolution of ConnectFour and other game states through the lens of minimax search algorithms.</p>\\r\\n<p>To define the rules and starting state of the game Connect Four, we can pass some of the functions you wrote above to the <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> constructor. In <tt>lab2.py</tt>, you can find two examples of an <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> object representing a Connect Four game:</p>\\r\\n<pre># This AbstractGameState represents a new ConnectFourBoard, before the game has started:\\r\\nstate_starting_connectfour = AbstractGameState(snapshot = ConnectFourBoard(),\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n\\r\\n# This AbstractGameState represents the ConnectFourBoard \"NEARLY_OVER\" from boards.py:\\r\\nstate_NEARLY_OVER = AbstractGameState(snapshot = NEARLY_OVER,\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Part_2:_Searching_a_game_tree\"></a>\\r\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\">Part 2: Searching a game tree </span></h2>\\r\\n<p>This part of the lab involves writing search functions on game trees made out of <tt>AbstractGameStates</tt>. The utility functions from Part 1 allow you to construct an <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> out of Connect Four boards, but the methods you write will work on other games as well.</p>\\r\\n<p>Abstract game states have methods for:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Checking whether the game is over (<tt><strong>state</strong>.is_game_over()</tt>).</li>\\r\\n<li>Generating a list of the resulting game state for each legal move (<tt><strong>state</strong>.generate_next_states()</tt>)</li>\\r\\n<li>Returning an object representing a current snapshot of the game.</li>\\r\\n<li>Computing the endgame score of a state, if the game is over.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>There are other methods and attributes as well; for a more complete list, <a title=\"\" href=\"#AbstractGameState\">see the API</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>About sample game states</strong>: To help you test out your search algorithms in this section, we provide several sample game states for Connect Four in your <tt>lab2.py</tt> file. There are also print statements that you can uncomment to see examples of what each algorithm returns.

In particular, all of the search algorithms we\\'ve studied so far have been non-adversarial because they assume that you have the same goal at each level of the tree (rather than players taking turns to move toward opposing goals). Imagine that both players are trying to collaboratively find the path that leads to the highest score. We will search the tree in depth-first search order to find the path leading to the highest score.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your task will be to implement this non-adversarial DFS maximizing search. It should be very similar to the DFS search from the previous lab, with two key differences:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>This search should not terminate once it has found a path to a \"goal.\" Instead, the search should explore all possible paths to all leaves (end-game states), just in a depth-first order. After finding all such paths, the best one (the one with the largest end-game state score) is chosen and returned.</li>\\r\\n<li>This algorithm should not only return the best path, but also the score of that path (the score of the end-game state at the end of that path) and the number of static evaluations that were computed. This will be explained in detail below.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>We will use this search as a jumping-off point for the remainder of this lab. After implementing this DFS maximizing search, we will start building other algorithms on top of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Implement the function <tt>dfs_maximizing</tt>, which takes as input a state of type AbstractGameState and should return a tuple containing, in order,</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the best path: a list of <tt>AbstractGameStates</tt> illustrating the sequence of moves necessary to achieve the highest score, starting with the initial state;</li>\\r\\n<li>the score value of the leaf node: a number; and</li>\\r\\n<li>the number of static evaluations you performed during search: a number.

The boolean argument <tt>maximize</tt> determines whether the current player is the maximizer or not.

Additionally, you might find some methods from the API helpful, such as state.get_endgame_score(is_current_player_maximizer=True).</p>\\r\\n<p>As you move through the minimax variations, a helpful hint might be to consider how each of these functions are similar to one another!</p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to review how minimax works, here are a couple resources:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><a class=\"external text\" title=\"http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/ai3/ch6.pdf\" href=\"http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/ai3/ch6.pdf\">Chapter 6 of the textbook</a></li>\\r\\n<li><a class=\"external text\" title=\"http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/handout3-fall11.pdf\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/handout3-fall11.pdf\">Prof. Bob Berwick\\'s notes on minimax and alpha-beta</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<a name=\"Minimax_with_heuristic_and_endgame_scores\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Minimax with heuristic and endgame scores </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>The previous version of minimax that you wrote could only handle endgame states.

In the first part of this lab, you\\'ll work with the game Connect Four, writing methods to represent states of a Connect Four game as a game tree.\\nIn the second part of this lab, you\\'ll write subroutines for performing various search functions on a game tree, including\\n\\ndepth-first search,\\nordinary minimax search,\\nminimax search with alpha-beta pruning, and\\nprogressive deepening.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPart 1: Utility functions for playing Connect Four \\n\\nRepresenting Connect Four as a game tree \\n\\nConnect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping a token into a 6 x 7 grid. The first player to build a consecutive sequence of four of their own tokens wins the game. The sequence of four tokens can lie either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this way, Connect Four is similar to other games you might know, such as Tic-tac-toe.\\nStated more abstractly, Connect Four is a game where each player has seven possible moves in a turn, corresponding to the seven columns where the player can drop the piece (unless the column is full, in which case the player cannot move there).\\nWe have provided an API for constructing and manipulating Connect Four boards. We suggest you take a look at the API now before getting started. For the first part of this lab, you will define subroutines that\\n\\ndetermine whether the game is over,\\ngenerate a player\\'s set of possible moves, and\\nassign scores to boards.\\n\\nThese subroutines will provide the necessary definitions for treating Connect Four boards as states in a game tree, which will be useful in the second half of this lab.\\n\\nGame over \\nReturn True if the game is over, otherwise False. The game is over when the board contains a chain of length 4 (or longer), or all columns are full.\\ndef is_game_over_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\n\\nGenerating all possible moves \\nReturn a list of boards representing the game state that can result by making a single move in any legal column.\\nFirst, you should check in advance if the game is already over and return the empty list if so. If the game is not over, then, at most, you can move in any of the seven columns. But you cannot legally move in a column if it\\'s full, and so you should exclude those.\\nNote that these next-states that are generated should be the result of the current player playing a piece, which means that in each of the next-states, the other player is the \"current\" player because they have yet to make a move.\\nFor each board in the list, board.prev_move_string() notes the column in which a piece was played (for debugging purposes).\\nNote: iterate over columns in increasing numerical order.\\ndef next_boards_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\n\\nAssigning points to the winner \\nHere, we\\'ll define the final score of a Connect Four game that has been won. We\\'ll return a score of 1000 if the maximizer has won, or -1000 if the minimizer has won. In case of a tie, return 0 instead. A tie occurs when the entire board fills up but has no chains of 4 or more same-colored tokens.\\nImportant subtlety regarding endgame scoring: We don\\'t know if a game is over until we take the board and call is_game_over_connectfour(board) on it. The board represents the state of the game after the previous player moved, but before the current player has played. Hence, if the game is already over, it\\'s because the previous player played the final move, ending the game. Therefore, if the game is over and someone has won, it\\'s not the current player who has won, because it just became the current player\\'s \"turn\"; instead, the previous player has won.\\nIn short, although it is slightly counter-intuitive, the endgame scoring function should return -1000 for a winning board if the current player is the maximizer (because that means the minimizer played the winning move), and +1000 if the current player is the minimizer.\\ndef endgame_score_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\n\\nWin already! \\nThe previous endgame_score_connectfour function has the drawback that it doesn\\'t reward players for winning sooner, since all winning states have the same value. Therefore, it doesn\\'t encourage the computer to win as fast as possible the way a human would. To remedy this, write a score function that rewards players for winning sooner: that is, it should assign a better score to games that are won in fewer moves.\\nTo retain consistency with your other endgame scoring function, make sure you return a value with abs(score) >= 1000 to indicate that someone has won. (In this lab, scores of magnitude 1000 or greater will correspond to winning game states, whereas scores of magnitude < 1000 will correspond to games that have not yet been won.)\\ndef endgame_score_connectfour_faster(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nHint: you can use board.count_pieces() to help determine how long the game has gone on.\\n\\nA heuristic for ConnectFour boards \\nIn practice, it is infeasible to search all the way to the leaves of the game tree in order to find a score. (Imagine ranking opening chess moves by whether they are automatic wins/losses for perfect play.)\\nInstead, here we will define a heuristic for estimating the \"goodness\" of a state --- specifically the goodness of a Connect Four board --- and use that in place of an endgame scoring function when we want to stop evaluation before reaching the end of the game.\\nIn practice, designing accurate heuristics greatly assists the decision making of strong game-playing AIs. Developing a good heuristic is a matter of design: there are many possible strategies and ways of measuring/defining the goodness of a state; for the purposes of this lab, you only need to define a scoring function that gives better scores for obviously stronger Connect Four positions.\\ndef heuristic_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nAs a hint, much of the information about the goodness of a state concerns the number and length of both players\\' chains. And, just to remain consistent with endgame scores, the absolute value of the heuristic scores should be scaled to be less than 1000. As before, the returned score will be negated depending on whether the current player is the maximizer.\\nFor example, you might return:\\n\\n500 for a board in which the maximizer is doing much better\\n10 for a board in which the maximizer is doing only slightly better\\n0 for a board in which neither player seems to have an advantage\\n-10 for a board in which the minimizer is doing slightly better\\n...and so on.\\n\\n\\nOn to Abstract Game States \\nTransforming the game into an abstract game state will allow us to explore the evolution of ConnectFour and other game states through the lens of minimax search algorithms.\\nTo define the rules and starting state of the game Connect Four, we can pass some of the functions you wrote above to the AbstractGameState constructor. In lab2.py, you can find two examples of an AbstractGameState object representing a Connect Four game:\\n# This AbstractGameState represents a new ConnectFourBoard, before the game has started:\\r\\nstate_starting_connectfour = AbstractGameState(snapshot = ConnectFourBoard(),\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n\\r\\n# This AbstractGameState represents the ConnectFourBoard \"NEARLY_OVER\" from boards.py:\\r\\nstate_NEARLY_OVER = AbstractGameState(snapshot = NEARLY_OVER,\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n\\n\\nPart 2: Searching a game tree \\nThis part of the lab involves writing search functions on game trees made out of AbstractGameStates. The utility functions from Part 1 allow you to construct an AbstractGameState out of Connect Four boards, but the methods you write will work on other games as well.\\nAbstract game states have methods for:\\n\\nChecking whether the game is over (state.is_game_over()).\\nGenerating a list of the resulting game state for each legal move (state.generate_next_states())\\nReturning an object representing a current snapshot of the game.\\nComputing the endgame score of a state, if the game is over.\\n\\nThere are other methods and attributes as well; for a more complete list, see the API.\\nAbout sample game states: To help you test out your search algorithms in this section, we provide several sample game states for Connect Four in your lab2.py file. There are also print statements that you can uncomment to see examples of what each algorithm returns. You can also print the current snapshot of an AbstractGameState object to get intuition for the current state of the game.\\n\\nCooperative depth-first search \\nTo start, we will see what non-adversarial search looks like. In particular, all of the search algorithms we\\'ve studied so far have been non-adversarial because they assume that you have the same goal at each level of the tree (rather than players taking turns to move toward opposing goals). Imagine that both players are trying to collaboratively find the path that leads to the highest score. We will search the tree in depth-first search order to find the path leading to the highest score.\\nYour task will be to implement this non-adversarial DFS maximizing search. It should be very similar to the DFS search from the previous lab, with two key differences:\\n\\nThis search should not terminate once it has found a path to a \"goal.\" Instead, the search should explore all possible paths to all leaves (end-game states), just in a depth-first order. After finding all such paths, the best one (the one with the largest end-game state score) is chosen and returned.\\nThis algorithm should not only return the best path, but also the score of that path (the score of the end-game state at the end of that path) and the number of static evaluations that were computed. This will be explained in detail below.\\n\\nWe will use this search as a jumping-off point for the remainder of this lab. After implementing this DFS maximizing search, we will start building other algorithms on top of it.\\nImplement the function dfs_maximizing, which takes as input a state of type AbstractGameState and should return a tuple containing, in order,\\n\\nthe best path: a list of AbstractGameStates illustrating the sequence of moves necessary to achieve the highest score, starting with the initial state;\\nthe score value of the leaf node: a number; and\\nthe number of static evaluations you performed during search: a number. (Remember that a static evaluation can happen by calculating an endgame score or a heuristic score, but not by recursing on a node\\'s children.)\\n\\ndef dfs_maximizing(state)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nIn case two moves have the same score, break ties by preferring earlier branches to later branches (i.e. if two moves have the same score, prefer the earlier one).\\nDebugging hints:\\n\\nYou can use the method pretty_print_dfs_type(result) to print the result from dfs_maximizing (or any of the later minimax search functions) in a human-readable way.\\nYou can also use the built-in print to print ConnectFourBoard and AbstractGameState objects.\\n\\n\\nMinimax search with endgame scores only \\nFind the minimax path. The boolean argument maximize determines whether the current player is the maximizer or not. This function should have the same return type as dfs; that is, it should return a tuple containing the minimax path, the minimax score, and the number of static evaluations performed during search.\\ndef minimax_endgame_search(state, maximize=True)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nIn case two moves have the same minimax score, break ties by preferring earlier branches to later branches (i.e. if two moves have the same minimax score, prefer the earlier one.)\\nImportant clarification: Either the maximizer or the minimizer may make the first move, so to determine which player is maximizing, don\\'t look at the game state itself --- look at the maximize argument to the search function. Additionally, you might find some methods from the API helpful, such as state.get_endgame_score(is_current_player_maximizer=True).\\nAs you move through the minimax variations, a helpful hint might be to consider how each of these functions are similar to one another!\\nIf you want to review how minimax works, here are a couple resources:\\n\\nChapter 6 of the textbook\\nProf. Bob Berwick\\'s notes on minimax and alpha-beta\\n\\n\\nMinimax with heuristic and endgame scores \\nThe previous version of minimax that you wrote could only handle endgame states. Now we\\'ll define minimax search that can search to any shallower depth, using a heuristic score instead of an endgame score for states that are not endgame states.\\n\\nWhat is depth?\\nWe define depth to be how many ancestors a node has: at the root of a tree, the depth is 0; one level down, the depth is 1, and so on. Hence, when we refer to a depth limit of (say) 3, that means the algorithm should look ahead by up to 3 levels, including the level at depth = 3.\\n\\nDefine minimax search that can search up to any specified depth in the tree. Given a state, your algorithm should:\\n\\nEvaluate the state using the endgame scoring function (state.get_endgame_score) if the state is an endgame state.\\nEvaluate the board using the heuristic_fn if the state is at the limit of search.\\nOr otherwise, generate all subsequent moves, recurse on them, and amalgamate the results.\\nBreak ties by preferring earlier branches to later branches (i.e. if two moves have the same minimax score, prefer the earlier one.)\\n\\nThis function should have the same return type as the other search methods above. When counting evaluations, you should include both the number of endgame score evaluations and the number of heuristic score evaluations.\\ndef minimax_search(state, heuristic_fn=always_zero, depth_limit=INF, maximize=True)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nBy default, minimax_search uses the heuristic function always_zero(state, maximize=True), which returns a score of zero for any board.\\nImportant Note: The scoring functions state.get_endgame_score(is_current_player_maximizer=True) and heuristic_fn(board, maximize=True) differ in three key ways:\\n\\nEndgame scores are used only for leaf nodes of the game tree; heuristic functions are used only for non-leaf nodes.\\nBecause endgame score is an objective measure of endgame value, it is a method of the AbstractGameState; in contrast, heuristic_fn is an argument of the search function, and varies depending on the priorities of the player.\\nThe method .get_endgame_score applies to Abstract Game State objects; in contrast, heuristic functions apply to the underlying snapshot objects. For example, the heuristic_connectfour function (defined above) takes a ConnectFourBoard object as its main argument.\\n\\nBoth state.get_endgame_score and heuristic_fn take in a boolean argument is_current_player_maximizer. For state.get_endgame_score, the default value for this argument is True.\\nTo better visualize why looking deeper into a game is so important, uncomment and try minimax_search on \"BOARD_UHOH\".\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMinimax with alpha-beta optimization \\nPerform alpha-beta pruning, with the same return type as minimax_search:\\ndef minimax_search_alphabeta(state, alpha=-INF, beta=INF, heuristic_fn=always_zero, depth_limit=INF, maximize=True)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nIf you want to review how alpha-beta pruning works, here are a few resources:\\n\\nDylan\\'s alpha-beta demo\\nChapter 6 of the textbook\\nProf. Bob Berwick\\'s notes on minimax and alpha-beta\\n\\n\\nJust for fun: Play against your AI! \\nWhen you\\'re done implementing minimax_search_alphabeta, you can run play_game.py to play Connect Four against your AI!\\n\\nUse progressive deepening to return anytime values \\nIn this final section, you\\'ll write a progressive deepening algorithm which uses minimax with alpha-beta pruning to search progressively deeper into the tree until time runs out. The arguments to progressive_deepening are identical to minimax_search, but the return type is an AnytimeValue object. You can declare a new AnytimeValue object like any other object. For example, anytime_value = AnytimeValue().\\nAnytimeValue objects are simple, with the following methods:\\n\\n\\n.set_value(val): sets the value to the val and stores val in the AnytimeValue\\'s history\\n\\n.get_value(): returns the current value\\n\\n.pretty_print(): prints the AnytimeValue\\'s history in human-readable format\\n\\nYou can code progressive deepening using a similar technique to the other search algorithms. Here, you\\'ll make iterative calls to minimax_search_alphabeta, increasing the depth each time. But at each level when minimax_search_alphabeta returns a new value, store that most recent result using anytime_value.set_value(new_best_option).\\ndef progressive_deepening(state, heuristic_fn=always_zero, depth_limit=INF, maximize=True)\\xa0:\\r\\n\\nDebugging hints:\\n\\nBe sure to search all the way to the depth limit (as opposed to stopping at depth_limit - 1)\\nConsider this question: What is the shallowest (smallest) depth you can search to while still obtaining useful information about which move to make?\\n\\n\\nOptional: Incorporate real time into your anytime algorithm! \\nThe progressive deepening function you just implemented will continue to run until it reaches its depth limit, because it doesn\\'t have the concept of a time limit. There are no tests for this section -- it\\'s difficult to test timed algorithms because the performance will vary greatly from one machine to another -- but here are some instructions in case you\\'d like add a time limit to your progressive deepening algorithm.\\ndef progressive_deepening(state, heuristic_fn=always_zero, depth_limit=INF, maximize=True, time_limit=INF)\\r\\n\\n\\nAdd a time_limit parameter to the signature of your function, as shown above.\\nThen, import and use a function such as time.time() to keep track of how much time has elapsed since your algorithm started running.\\r\\n\\nAt regular intervals (e.g. before progressing to the next level of progressive deepening), check whether time has run out by comparing the elapsed time to the permitted time_limit. If you want, you could even incorporate the time-limit checking into alpha-beta by passing the time_limit argument into your alpha-beta function.\\n\\n\\nTry running your modified progressive_deepening function with a time limit (e.g. time_limit=15) and no depth limit (depth_limit=INF) and see what happens! You should observe that as you increase the time limit, progressive_deepening will have time to look further ahead in the game tree.\\n\\n\\nPart 3: Conceptual Questions \\nHere are a few multiple-choice questions to test your conceptual understanding of the material in this lab. For explanations of the answers, look near the bottom of tests.py\\nFill in the answer to each question in ANSWER_i at the bottom of lab2.py. Each answer should be a string: \\'1\\', \\'2\\', \\'3\\', \\'4\\', or \\'5\\'.\\nQuestions 1-3 refer to a game tree shaped like the one below (i.e. a binary tree of depth three, with eight leaves). When answering the questions, consider all possible game trees of this shape:\\n\\nQuestion 1: Suppose our game tree is of the above shape, and we are running endgame minimax search with no heuristic, and without alpha-beta pruning. Which of the following conditions will guarantee that we will not be required to examine all eight leaves of the tree?\\n\\nWhen the sequence of leaves generated by doing a depth-first traversal is monotonically decreasing, and the current player is MAX\\nWhen the values of the leaves are randomly generated\\nWe will never have to examine all eight leaves, regardless of whose turn it is or what the values of the leaves are\\nWe will always have to examine all eight leaves, regardless of whose turn it is or what the values of the leaves are\\nNone of the above\\n\\nQuestion 2: Suppose our game tree is of the above shape, and we are running endgame minimax search with alpha-beta pruning. Which of the following conditions will guarantee that we will not be required to examine all eight leaves of the tree?\\n\\nWhen the sequence of leaves generated by doing a depth-first traversal is monotonically decreasing, and the current player is MAX\\nWhen the values of the leaves are randomly generated\\nWe will never have to examine all eight leaves, regardless of whose turn it is or what the values of the leaves are\\nWe will always have to examine all eight leaves, regardless of whose turn it is or what the values of the leaves are\\nNone of the above\\n\\nQuestion 3: Suppose you just ran endgame minimax search with alpha-beta pruning (with depth_limit=INF and heuristic_fn=always_zero) on some game tree T of the above shape, but your algorithm didn\\'t prune any leaves from T. You\\'re unhappy with this result! You want your algorithm to prune some leaves! Which of the following changes to your alpha-beta search algorithm would likely increase the number of leaves pruned while searching T?\\n\\nSwap the order of the root node\\'s children\\nFor each of the seven non-leaf nodes, randomly pick an order for the two children of that node\\nUse a different, better heuristic_fn instead of always_zero\\n\\nBoth 1 and 2\\nAll of 1, 2, and 3\\n\\nQuestion 4: This question does not refer to the above tree; it could refer to any game tree. Suppose an adversary, Eve, knows the exact implementation of your alpha-beta search, as well as the static value (heuristic or endgame score) of every node in the game tree you\\'re about to search. Before running your algorithm on a particular game tree, Eve may decide to reorder the children of any number of nodes in the tree. Being an adversary, Eve\\'s intention is to order nodes so that your alpha-beta algorithm will prune as few leaves as possible. (Note Eve is not allowed to shear the tree -- i.e. change the parent of a node -- and Eve is not allowed to modify the tree once your algorithm has started running.)\\nWith this in mind, which of the following is the best change you can make to your algorithm to maximize the number of nodes that you can expect to prune? In other words, how can you make Eve\\'s efforts worthless? Note that Eve will also see any changes you make to your code and will have an opportunity to reorder the tree after you make your changes!\\n\\nHave your algorithm pick a random number n at the start of execution, then run alpha-beta on the game tree n times, averaging the results each time.\\nSet heuristic_fn=always_zero, which means that the heuristic score for any node is zero.\\nSet heuristic_fn=random_int, where random_int is a function that returns a random integer, regardless of game state.\\nSet depth_limit to something tiny like 1 or 2, forcing your search to rely heavily on heuristics and not endgame scores.\\nInstead of doing standard DFS search, have your algorithm explore the children of each node in a random order.\\n\\n\\nAPI \\nThroughout this lab, you can use the constant INF in lab2.py to represent infinity.\\n\\nConnectFourBoard \\nConnectFourBoard is class for probing and manipulating the state of a Connect Four game. A ConnectFourBoard has players (represented by their name strings), and pieces. Players\\' pieces are represented by numbers: 1 denotes the first player\\'s piece, 2 denotes the second player\\'s piece, and 0 denotes an empty space in the board.\\nThe dimensions of the board are stored as class attributes:\\n\\nnum_rows\\nThe number of rows in the board (= 6).\\n\\n\\nnum_cols\\nThe number of columns in the board (= 7).\\n\\nWe provide methods for acquiring information about the pieces in the board:\\n\\ncount_pieces(current_player=None)\\nWith no arguments, returns the total number of pieces on the board. Otherwise, returns the number of pieces owned by the current player (current_player = True) or by the other player (current_player = False).\\n\\n\\nget_all_chains(current_player=None)\\nWith no arguments, returns a list of all maximal contiguous chains of pieces. (A chain is a sequence of pieces belonging to a single player, arranged either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.) Each chain is a list of 1s (for pieces belonging to the player who moved first) or 2s (for pieces belonging to the player who moved second.) If current_player=True, returns only chains belonging to the current player. If current_player=False, returns only chains belonging to the other player.\\n\\n\\nget_piece(col, row)\\nReturn the piece in the given column and row. The Connect Four board has seven columns and six rows. Return value is 1 (a piece owned by the first player), 2 (a piece owned by the second player), or 0 (if the space is empty).\\n\\nYou can also investigate or make moves in particular columns:\\n\\nis_column_full(col_number)\\nGiven an integer between 0 (leftmost column) and 6 (rightmost column), returns a boolean value representing whether the column is full of pieces or not.\\n\\n\\nadd_piece(col_number)\\nAdds the current player\\'s piece to the given column. This method does not modify the original board, but instead returns a new ConnectFourBoard object with the piece added. In the new board, the current player will have swapped.\\n\\n\\nget_column_height(col_number)\\nReturn the number of pieces in the specified column. The returned value will be a number between 0 (no pieces in the column) and 6 (the column is full).\\n\\nThere are two players who are represented by their names (as strings). The names are entirely irrelevant, but names may make debugging more intuitive. Note: Player names do not determine which player is the maximizer and which player is the minimizer; those roles are attributes of the search algorithms, not the game itself.\\n\\nplayers\\nThe list of the players\\' names. The order will change so that the current player is always first in the list.\\n\\n\\nget_player_name(n)\\nReturn the name of the player who moved first (n=1) or second (n=2) in this game.\\n\\nFinally, you can make a copy of a board, in case you want to modify a copy without modifying the original:\\n\\ncopy()\\nReturns a (deep) copy of the board.\\n\\n\\nHow chains of pieces are represented \\nConnect Four is built around chains of pieces; a chain is a sequence of a single player\\'s pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here\\'s an example of a board and the chains in it.\\nThis is a completed Connect Four game between two players named Red Fish (who uses red pieces and moves first) and Blue Fish (who uses black pieces and moves second):\\n\\nPython\\'s printed representation of the board looks like this:\\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\r\\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\r\\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\r\\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\r\\n_ _ 2 2 2 _ _ \\r\\n1 1 1 1 2 1 _ \\r\\n\\nOptionally, if you want to see how the board is encoded, you can find it in boards.py, defined as BOARD_REDFISH_WON_LESS_FAST.\\nIf you call board.get_all_chains() with no arguments, it returns the following list:\\n[[1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 2]]   \\r\\n\\nThese are all the chains in the board:\\n\\n1 has a piece by itself on the far right.\\n2 has a horizontal chain of three pieces.\\n1 has a horizontal chain of four pieces (Winning the game!).\\n2 has a vertical chain of two pieces.\\n2 has a diagonal chain of two pieces (in the \"northwest\" diagonal direction)\\n\\nYou can also call get_all_chains with a boolean argument, in which case it will return only chains belonging to the current player (True) or other player (False). For example in this case, since it would have been 2\\'s turn if 1 hadn\\'t already won, board.get_all_chains(True) returns:\\n [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2]]   \\r\\n\\nwhich are the chains belonging to 2 in the complete list returned above.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAbstractGameState \\nAbstractGameState is a class which encodes the rules of a game and a snapshot of its current position. They are generic enough to encode the rules of any game that can be played with minimax.\\nAbstractGameState objects can be traversed like trees:\\n\\ngenerate_next_states()\\nGet the children of this node in the game tree, returning a list of AbstractGameState objects corresponding to the result of each possible legal move. If there are no possible moves, return the empty list.\\n\\n\\nis_game_over()\\nReturns True if this is a leaf node in the game tree, otherwise False.\\n\\n\\nget_endgame_score(is_current_player_maximizer=True)\\nIf this node is a leaf node (i.e. an endgame state), returns its final score. The score will be negated depending on whether the current player is a maximizer (default) or not. If this node is not a leaf node, throws an error.\\n\\nYou can also access an internal snapshot of the current game. This allows you to access game-specific details such as the number of pieces in a Connect Four board. The snapshot will also be helpful because heuristic score functions evaluate not the AbstractGameState object, but its snapshot of the current position. (This is an implementation difference between endgame scoring functions and heuristic scoring functions.)\\n\\nget_snapshot()\\nReturns a snapshot of the current state of the game. Depending on the game, the type of the returned object may be different. For example, if the game is Connect Four, the snapshot will be a ConnectFourBoard object.\\n\\nFinally, you may find the following methods useful when debugging:\\n\\ndescribe_previous_move()\\nReturns a string representing how the current state was generated from its parent. For example, if the game is Connect Four, previous move strings look like \"Put Player Two\\'s piece in column 4.\"\\n\\n\\nrestart()\\nReset the game to the initial state. Returns the reset AbstractGameState object.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSurvey \\nPlease answer these questions at the bottom of your lab file:\\n\\n\\nNAME: What is your name?

(string)\\n\\n\\n(optional) SUGGESTIONS: What specific changes would you recommend, if any, to improve this lab for future years? (string)\\n\\n(We\\'d ask which parts you find confusing, but if you\\'re confused you should really ask a TA.)\\nWhen you\\'re done, run the online tester to submit your code.\\n\\nFAQ \\nQ: When I run the tester, I\\'m getting a weird error that looks like\\nAttributeError: \\'AbstractGameState\\' object has no attribute \\'get_all_chains\\'\\r\\n\\nor\\nAttributeError: \\'AbstractGameState\\' object has no attribute \\'board_array\\'\\r\\n\\nA: This happens when you try to call heuristic_fn on an AbstractGameState instead of on the underlying snapshot. A heuristic function only makes sense when it\\'s tied to a particular game, not to any abstract game.\\n'"
