The first player to build a consecutive sequence of four of their own tokens wins the game. The sequence of four tokens can lie either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this way, Connect Four is similar to other games you might know, such as Tic-tac-toe.</p>\\r\\n<p>Stated more abstractly, Connect Four is a game where each player has seven possible moves in a turn, corresponding to the seven columns where the player can drop the piece (unless the column is full, in which case the player cannot move there).</p>\\r\\n<p>We have provided an <a title=\"\" href=\"#ConnectFourBoard\">API</a> for constructing and manipulating Connect Four boards. We suggest you take a look at the API now before getting started. For the first part of this lab, you will define subroutines that</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>determine whether the game is over,</li>\\r\\n<li>generate a player\\'s set of possible moves, and</li>\\r\\n<li>assign scores to boards.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>These subroutines will provide the necessary definitions for treating Connect Four boards as states in a game tree, which will be useful in the second half of this lab.</p>\\r\\n<a name=\"Game_over\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Game over </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Return <tt>True</tt> if the game is over, otherwise <tt>False</tt>. The game is over when the board contains a chain of length 4 (or longer), or all columns are full.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def is_game_over_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Generating_all_possible_moves\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Generating all possible moves </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Return a list of boards representing the game state that can result by making a single move in any legal column.</p>\\r\\n<p>First, you should check in advance if the game is already over and return the empty list if so. If the game is not over, then, at most, you can move in any of the seven columns. But you cannot legally move in a column if it\\'s full, and so you should exclude those.</p>\\r\\n<p>Note that these next-states that are generated should be the result of the <i>current</i> player playing a piece, which means that in each of the next-states, the <i>other</i> player is the \"current\" player because they have yet to make a move.</p>\\r\\n<p>For each board in the list, <tt>board.prev_move_string()</tt> notes the column in which a piece was played (for debugging purposes).</p>\\r\\n<p>Note: iterate over columns in increasing numerical order.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def next_boards_connectfour(board)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Assigning_points_to_the_winner\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Assigning points to the winner </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Here, we\\'ll define the final score of a Connect Four game that has been won. We\\'ll return a score of 1000 if the maximizer has won, or -1000 if the minimizer has won. In case of a tie, return 0 instead. A tie occurs when the entire board fills up but has no chains of 4 or more same-colored tokens.</p>\\r\\n<p>Important subtlety regarding endgame scoring: We don\\'t know if a game is over until we take the board and call <tt>is_game_over_connectfour(board)</tt> on it. The board represents the state of the game after the previous player moved, but before the current player has played. Hence, if the game is already over, it\\'s because <i>the previous player played the final move, ending the game.</i> Therefore, if the game is over and someone has won, it\\'s not the <i>current</i> player who has won, because it just became the current player\\'s \"turn\"; instead, the previous player has won.</p>\\r\\n<p>In short, although it is slightly counter-intuitive, the endgame scoring function should return -1000 for a winning board if the current player is the maximizer (because that means the minimizer played the winning move), and +1000 if the current player is the minimizer.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def endgame_score_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Win_already.21\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Win already! </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>The previous <tt>endgame_score_connectfour</tt> function has the drawback that it doesn\\'t reward players for winning sooner, since all winning states have the same value. Therefore, it doesn\\'t encourage the computer to win as fast as possible the way a human would. To remedy this, write a score function that rewards players for winning sooner: that is, it should assign a better score to games that are won in fewer moves.</p>\\r\\n<p>To retain consistency with your other endgame scoring function, make sure you return a value with <tt>abs(score) &gt;= 1000</tt> to indicate that someone has won. (In this lab, scores of magnitude 1000 or greater will correspond to winning game states, whereas scores of magnitude &lt; 1000 will correspond to games that have not yet been won.)</p>\\r\\n<pre>def endgame_score_connectfour_faster(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<p>Hint: you can use <tt>board.count_pieces()</tt> to help determine how long the game has gone on.</p>\\r\\n<a name=\"A_heuristic_for_ConnectFour_boards\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">A heuristic for ConnectFour boards </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>In practice, it is infeasible to search all the way to the leaves of the game tree in order to find a score. (Imagine ranking opening chess moves by whether they are automatic wins/losses for perfect play.)</p>\\r\\n<p>Instead, here we will define a heuristic for estimating the \"goodness\" of a state --- specifically the goodness of a Connect Four board --- and use that in place of an endgame scoring function when we want to stop evaluation before reaching the end of the game.</p>\\r\\n<p>In practice, designing accurate heuristics greatly assists the decision making of strong game-playing AIs. Developing a good heuristic is a matter of design: there are many possible strategies and ways of measuring/defining the goodness of a state; for the purposes of this lab, you only need to define a scoring function that gives better scores for obviously stronger Connect Four positions.</p>\\r\\n<pre>def heuristic_connectfour(board, is_current_player_maximizer)\\xa0:\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<p>As a hint, much of the information about the goodness of a state concerns the <strong>number and length of both players\\' chains</strong>. And, just to remain consistent with endgame scores, the absolute value of the heuristic scores should be scaled to be less than 1000. As before, the returned score will be negated depending on whether the current player is the maximizer.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, you might return:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>500 for a board in which the maximizer is doing much better</li>\\r\\n<li>10 for a board in which the maximizer is doing only slightly better</li>\\r\\n<li>0 for a board in which neither player seems to have an advantage</li>\\r\\n<li>-10 for a board in which the minimizer is doing slightly better</li>\\r\\n<li>...and so on.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<a name=\"On_to_Abstract_Game_States\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">On to Abstract Game States </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>Transforming the game into an abstract game state will allow us to explore the evolution of ConnectFour and other game states through the lens of minimax search algorithms.</p>\\r\\n<p>To define the rules and starting state of the game Connect Four, we can pass some of the functions you wrote above to the <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> constructor. In <tt>lab2.py</tt>, you can find two examples of an <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> object representing a Connect Four game:</p>\\r\\n<pre># This AbstractGameState represents a new ConnectFourBoard, before the game has started:\\r\\nstate_starting_connectfour = AbstractGameState(snapshot = ConnectFourBoard(),\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n\\r\\n# This AbstractGameState represents the ConnectFourBoard \"NEARLY_OVER\" from boards.py:\\r\\nstate_NEARLY_OVER = AbstractGameState(snapshot = NEARLY_OVER,\\r\\n                                 is_game_over_fn = is_game_over_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 generate_next_states_fn = next_boards_connectfour,\\r\\n                                 endgame_score_fn = endgame_score_connectfour_faster)\\r\\n</pre>\\r\\n<a name=\"Part_2:_Searching_a_game_tree\"></a>\\r\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\">Part 2: Searching a game tree </span></h2>\\r\\n<p>This part of the lab involves writing search functions on game trees made out of <tt>AbstractGameStates</tt>. The utility functions from Part 1 allow you to construct an <tt>AbstractGameState</tt> out of Connect Four boards, but the methods you write will work on other games as well.</p>\\r\\n<p>Abstract game states have methods for:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Checking whether the game is over (<tt><strong>state</strong>.is_game_over()</tt>).</li>\\r\\n<li>Generating a list of the resulting game state for each legal move (<tt><strong>state</strong>.generate_next_states()</tt>)</li>\\r\\n<li>Returning an object representing a current snapshot of the game.</li>\\r\\n<li>Computing the endgame score of a state, if the game is over.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>There are other methods and attributes as well; for a more complete list, <a title=\"\" href=\"#AbstractGameState\">see the API</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>About sample game states</strong>: To help you test out your search algorithms in this section, we provide several sample game states for Connect Four in your <tt>lab2.py</tt> file. There are also print statements that you can uncomment to see examples of what each algorithm returns.

In particular, all of the search algorithms we\\'ve studied so far have been non-adversarial because they assume that you have the same goal at each level of the tree (rather than players taking turns to move toward opposing goals). Imagine that both players are trying to collaboratively find the path that leads to the highest score. We will search the tree in depth-first search order to find the path leading to the highest score.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your task will be to implement this non-adversarial DFS maximizing search. It should be very similar to the DFS search from the previous lab, with two key differences:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>This search should not terminate once it has found a path to a \"goal.\" Instead, the search should explore all possible paths to all leaves (end-game states), just in a depth-first order. After finding all such paths, the best one (the one with the largest end-game state score) is chosen and returned.</li>\\r\\n<li>This algorithm should not only return the best path, but also the score of that path (the score of the end-game state at the end of that path) and the number of static evaluations that were computed. This will be explained in detail below.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>We will use this search as a jumping-off point for the remainder of this lab. After implementing this DFS maximizing search, we will start building other algorithms on top of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Implement the function <tt>dfs_maximizing</tt>, which takes as input a state of type AbstractGameState and should return a tuple containing, in order,</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the best path: a list of <tt>AbstractGameStates</tt> illustrating the sequence of moves necessary to achieve the highest score, starting with the initial state;</li>\\r\\n<li>the score value of the leaf node: a number; and</li>\\r\\n<li>the number of static evaluations you performed during search: a number.

The boolean argument <tt>maximize</tt> determines whether the current player is the maximizer or not.

Additionally, you might find some methods from the API helpful, such as state.get_endgame_score(is_current_player_maximizer=True).</p>\\r\\n<p>As you move through the minimax variations, a helpful hint might be to consider how each of these functions are similar to one another!</p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to review how minimax works, here are a couple resources:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><a class=\"external text\" title=\"http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/ai3/ch6.pdf\" href=\"http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/ai3/ch6.pdf\">Chapter 6 of the textbook</a></li>\\r\\n<li><a class=\"external text\" title=\"http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/handout3-fall11.pdf\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/handout3-fall11.pdf\">Prof. Bob Berwick\\'s notes on minimax and alpha-beta</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<a name=\"Minimax_with_heuristic_and_endgame_scores\"></a>\\r\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\">Minimax with heuristic and endgame scores </span></h3>\\r\\n<p>The previous version of minimax that you wrote could only handle endgame states.
